Q1.What are the two values of the boolean data types? how do you write them?
Two values of the boolean data types are True and False.
We have to use capital T and F and with the rest of the word in lowercase. 
The type() of both False and True is boolean.
for eg:-
#input
a=True
b=False
print(type(a),type(b))
#output
<class 'bool'> <class 'bool'>

Q2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
The boolean operators other name is logical operators which operate on conditional statements.
and ->True if both operands are True else False
or  ->True if at least one operand is True else False
not ->Inverts True to False and False to True

Q3. Make a list of each Boolean operator&#39;s truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
#and
True and True --> True
True and False --> False
False and True --> False
False and False --> False
#or
True or True --> True
True or False --> True
False or True --> True
False or False --> False
#not
True not --> False 
False not --> True

Q4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5>4) and (3 == 5) -> False
not (5>4) -> False
(5>4) or (3 == 5)-> True
not ((5>4) or (3 == 5))-> False
(True and True) and (True == False)-> False
(not False) or (not True)->True

Q5. What are the six comparison operators?
==,>,>=,<,<=,!=

Q6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
