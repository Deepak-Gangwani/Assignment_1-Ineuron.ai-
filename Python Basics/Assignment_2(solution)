Q1.What are the two values of the boolean data types? how do you write them?
Answer
Two values of the boolean data types are True and False.
We have to use capital T and F and with the rest of the word in lowercase. 
The type() of both False and True is boolean.
for eg:-
#input
a=True
b=False
print(type(a),type(b))
#output
<class 'bool'> <class 'bool'>

Q2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Answer
The boolean operators other name is logical operators which operate on conditional statements.
and ->True if both operands are True else False
or  ->True if at least one operand is True else False
not ->Inverts True to False and False to True

Q3. Make a list of each Boolean operator&#39;s truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
Answer
#and
True and True --> True
True and False --> False
False and True --> False
False and False --> False
#or
True or True --> True
True or False --> True
False or True --> True
False or False --> False
#not
True not --> False 
False not --> True

Q4. What are the values of the following expressions?
Answer
(5>4) and (3 == 5) -> False
not (5>4) -> False
(5>4) or (3 == 5)-> True
not ((5>4) or (3 == 5))-> False
(True and True) and (True == False)-> False
(not False) or (not True)->True

Q5. What are the six comparison operators?
Answer)==,>,>=,<,<=,!=

Q6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
Answer
the equal(==) to operator that compares two values and evaluates both value are equal or not.Whereas,the assignment(=) operator
are used for assigning or storing data into variable
#equal
print(4==5)#evauluating whether the given statement is true or false
#assignment
a=10
print(a)#assigning the data by declaring the variable

Q7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
Answer
spam=0
if spam==10:
    print("eggs")
elif spam > 5:
    print("bacon")
else:
    print("ham")
    print("spam")
    print("spam")
#output
ham
spam
spam

Q8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Answer
spam=int(input("Enter the Number:-"))
if spam==1:
    print("Howdy")
elif spam==2:
    print("Greetings")
else:
    print("Spam")
#output    
Enter the Number:-1
Howdy

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Answer)ctrl-c to break the loop

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Answer)The break statement will move the execution outside the loop 
if break condtion is satisfied whereas the continue statement 
will move the execution to the start of the loop.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Answer
#The range(10) call range from 0 to 9 (but not include 10)
for i in range(10):
  print(i)
#The range (0,10) explicitly tells the loop to start at 0
for i in range(0,10):
  print(i)
#The range(0,10,1) explicitly tells the loop to increase the variable by 1 on each iteration
for i in range(0,10,1):
  print(i)
  
 12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Answer
#for loop
for i in range(1,11):
  print(i)
#While loop
i=1
while i<11:
  print(i)
  i=i+1
 
 13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
