Q1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
Answer
*=expressions
'hello'=Values
-87.8= not a values it's a float
-=expressions
/=expressions
+=expressions
6=value

Q2. What is the difference between string and variable?
Strings
a)string is a sequence of characters
b)string is a stream of characters
c)string is a data type in programming languages
d)string can start with space,digit or symbols also.
Variables
a)variable name can contain alphabets,digits and underscore.
b)variable name can only start with an alphabet and underscore
c)variable name cannot start with a digit
d)No while space is allowed to be used inside a variable name

Q3. Describe three different data types?
#Integers
Integers are the data type in programming Languages.An integer is a whole number that can be positive, negative, or zero. 
Examples of integers are: -5, 1, 5, 8, 97, and 3,043. 
Examples of numbers that are not integers are: -1.43, 1 3/4, 3.14, .
#Float
 float are the data type in programming languages.A float is a floating-point number, which means it is a number that has a decimal place. 
 Floats are used when more precision is needed.
#Strings 
String is a data type in programming languages.String is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
we can primarily write a string in these three ways
Single quoted string->a='Deepu'
Double quoted string->b="Deepu"
Triple quoted string->b='''Deepu'''

Q4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
Expression is made up of mathematical operator used in programming languages
the mathematical operator also named as arithmetic operator.
These all expression do their following task
+ ->Sum (a=2+1)
- ->Subtract(a=2-1)
* ->multiply(a=2*1)
/ ->Division(a=2/1)

Q5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?
Expression is made up of mathematical operator used in programming languages
the mathematical operator also named as arithmetic operator whereas statement is
a command that the interpreter used to execute like print

Q6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
Answer) After running the code the output will 23 because we have declared a variable
that is bacon and used arithmetic + operator for increment.

Q7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam'+'spamspam'=spamspamspam
'spam'*3=spamspamspam

Q8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
100 is ivalid because a variable can only start with an alphabet and underscore,
A variable name cannot start with a digit.

Q9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?
int(),float(),str()

Q10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten'+99+'burritos'=TypeError
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
so we can conclude that this expression cause an error.
We can fix it by converting integer into string
'I have eaten '+str(99)+' burritos'=I have eaten 99 burritos
