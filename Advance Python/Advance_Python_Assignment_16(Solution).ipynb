    "Ans)Regular Expressions, also known as `regex` or `regexp`, are used to match strings of text such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. It means that we can match and extract any string pattern from the text with the help of regular expressions. it helps the programmers to Write less and cleaner code. it also avoids multiple use of `if/else` statements. Regular expressions are a powerful feature of any language and solve a particular class of problems extraordinarily well. They can be used to validate user input, extract relevant data from a string, or even modify a string based on its contents.\n",

Capturing groups are a way to treat multiple characters as a single unit. They are created by placing the characters to be grouped inside a set of parentheses."
